      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-900">What Is a Mis-Sold Bank Account?</h3>
      <p class="text-blue-800 mt-2">
      Many high-street banks encouraged or pressured customers into opening “packaged” or “premium” accounts. These accounts came with a monthly fee — often between <strong>£10 and £30</strong> — in exchange for a bundle of additional benefits.
      </p>
      <p class="text-blue-800 mt-3">Common extras included:</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 mt-2 text-blue-800 space-y-3 marker:text-blue-600 marker:text-xl">
      <li>
      <strong>Mobile phone insurance</strong><br>
      Meant to cover repair or replacement if your phone was lost or damaged — but often limited by exclusions, excess fees, or models not being covered. Many people already had insurance elsewhere, making this redundant.
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Breakdown cover</strong><br>
      Usually advertised as roadside assistance or vehicle recovery — but in many cases, it didn’t apply if you were already covered by a car insurer or had limitations on age/type of vehicle. Some accounts charged customers who didn’t even drive.
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Travel insurance</strong><br>
      Often marketed as comprehensive, but excluded people over a certain age or those with pre-existing medical conditions. Many customers couldn’t use it, yet still paid monthly fees.
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>“Priority” customer service</strong><br>
      This vague benefit was sometimes just a marketing term. In practice, it rarely meant better service or faster support — just a label to justify the monthly cost.
      </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-4 text-blue-800">
      In many cases, bank staff failed to explain the true cost, eligibility criteria, or free alternatives. Customers were enrolled automatically, pressured during account upgrades, or misled about what they were paying for.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4 text-blue-900 font-medium">
      If you were charged for extras you didn’t need, couldn’t use, or didn’t knowingly agree to, you may have a claim for a full refund plus interest.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-900"><strong>Why Were These Accounts Mis-Sold?</strong></h3>
      <p class="text-blue-800 mt-2">
      Packaged or premium bank accounts were often mis-sold to customers due to unfair sales tactics, misinformation, or failure to follow proper procedures. Here are the most common reasons these accounts were considered mis-sold:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 mt-4 text-blue-800 space-y-3 marker:text-blue-600 marker:text-xl">
      <li>
      <strong>Failure to explain what was included in the account</strong><br>
      Many customers were not told exactly what they were paying for. Banks often listed vague “benefits” without clarifying what was actually included or how the services worked, leading to confusion and unnecessary charges.
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>No check on eligibility for included insurance</strong><br>
      Insurance (like travel or phone cover) often came with age limits, medical exclusions, or model restrictions. Many people were not eligible to claim — yet they were still sold the package and charged monthly.
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Claiming it was a requirement for a loan or overdraft</strong><br>
      Some customers were wrongly told they could only access credit, loans, or overdraft facilities if they upgraded to a paid account. This is against FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) guidance and is a clear mis-selling tactic.
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Lack of consent or proper documentation</strong><br>
      In some cases, customers were switched to a paid account without their full understanding or without signed agreements. Others were pressured over the phone or in-branch without being given proper time to decide.
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Fees continued even when account was unused</strong><br>
      Many people continued to pay monthly charges even after they stopped using the account or moved to another provider — either because they forgot, weren’t aware, or didn’t know how to cancel.
      </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-4 text-blue-900 font-medium">
      If any of these apply to you, you may have been mis-sold — and could be entitled to a refund of all fees paid, plus interest.
      </p>
      </div>

        <p class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-900"><strong>Your Right to Claim</strong></p>
        <p class="text-blue-800 mt-2">
          If you were misled, pressured, or charged for a packaged bank account you didn’t need or couldn’t use, you may have a legal right to claim back all the fees — plus interest. Here are the most common reasons people qualify for compensation:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 text-blue-800 space-y-3 marker:text-blue-600 marker:text-2xl">
          <li>
            <strong>You didn't know about the fees</strong><br>
            Many customers were enrolled into paid accounts without clearly being told there would be monthly charges. If you weren’t fully informed — or were misled into thinking it was free — that’s mis-selling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Insurance didn’t apply to you (e.g. due to age or health)</strong><br>
            Travel or phone insurance often came with strict conditions. If you were too old, had pre-existing conditions, or didn’t meet eligibility, the cover was useless — and the fees unjustified.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You never used the extras</strong><br>
            If you paid for benefits like breakdown cover or “priority” service but never used them — and especially if you didn’t ask for them — that’s a red flag. Many customers didn’t even know what they were paying for.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You were pressured or misled into upgrading</strong><br>
            Some bank staff implied (or outright stated) that you had to upgrade in order to get a loan, overdraft, or better service. This kind of pressure-selling is against Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules.
          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <p class="mt-4 text-blue-800">
          The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) and other regulators have ruled in favour of thousands of consumers. In fact, UK banks have already refunded over <strong>£1 billion</strong> for mis-sold accounts.
        </p>
      
        <p class="mt-2 text-blue-900 font-medium">
          If any of the above apply to you, you could be owed hundreds — or even thousands — in compensation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
        <p class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-900"><strong>How Much Can You Claim?</strong></p>
        <p class="text-blue-800 mt-2">
          If your bank account was mis-sold, you may be entitled to a full refund of the money you paid — and more. Here’s what a successful claim could include:
        </p>
      
        <ul class="list-none space-y-4 mt-4 text-blue-800">
          <li>
            ✅ <strong>Refund of all monthly fees (often £500 to £3,000+)</strong><br>
            If you paid a monthly charge for a packaged or premium account, you can claim back the total amount paid — sometimes over several years. For many people, this adds up to hundreds or even thousands of pounds.
          </li>
          <li>
            ✅ <strong>Interest at up to 8% per year</strong><br>
            In addition to the fees, you may be entitled to “statutory interest” on the money lost — calculated at up to 8% per year. This is added to compensate you for being without the money during that time.
          </li>
          <li>
            ✅ <strong>Related overdraft and penalty refunds</strong><br>
            If the mis-sold account made you more likely to go into overdraft, or if you incurred bank charges as a result of the account’s structure or fees, those penalties may also be refunded as part of your claim.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-4 text-blue-900 font-medium">
          Every case is different — but many successful claims result in £1,000–£4,000 in total compensation. We’ll calculate your potential refund as part of your free case review.

            Think it’s too late? It’s not. You can still claim compensation — even if:

          <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-blue-800 space-y-2 marker:text-blue-600 marker:text-xl">
            <li>
              <strong>Your bank account has already been closed</strong>  
              – You can still claim for mis-sold products even if the account is no longer active. Banks are required to review historic behaviour.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The mis-selling happened several years ago</strong>  
              – As long as you only recently discovered the issue or weren’t fully aware of your rights at the time, you may still be within the legal time limits.
