        <h3>Why You Should Avoid Owning a Timeshare:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising Maintenance Fees:</strong> Timeshare organisations have a history of employing misleading sales practices, which has contributed to a negative public perception. Promises made at the time of purchase have frequently turned out to be inaccurate, and in many cases, entirely unfulfilled.</li>
          <li><strong>Resale – Virtually Impossible:</strong> Reselling a timeshare is exceptionally difficult, particularly in a market where there is little to no demand for such properties. In practice, resale is rendered virtually impossible due to the restrictive contractual terms that any prospective buyer would be required to accept.</li>
          <li><strong>Misrepresentation:</strong> Timeshare organisations have a well-documented history of deceptive sales practices, which has led to widespread negative perception. Promises made during the sales process have often proven to be inaccurate, and in many instances, have not been fulfilled at all.</li>
          <li><strong>Lack of Flexibility in Exchange Programs:</strong> Although exchange programs are available, they are often subject to limited availability, restrictive conditions, and substantial fees. As a result, securing the desired holiday destination can be difficult. Moreover, the associated costs tend to increase annually.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
      <p><strong>Why Are So Many Timeshare Contracts Illegal?</strong><br>
      Many timeshare agreements signed over the past two decades violate European consumer protection law, especially the Timeshare Directive 2008/122/EC. This Directive was created to protect buyers from aggressive and deceptive sales tactics, and to ensure transparency in cross-border timeshare sales.</p>

      </div>
    </section>

    <div class="info-box">
      <p><strong>Here are just a few reasons why contracts may be invalid under EU law:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cooling-Off Period Violations:</strong> You are legally entitled to a 14-day cooling-off period after signing. During this time, the seller must not accept any payment. If money was taken – even a deposit – your contract could be void.</li>
        <li><strong>Missing Legal Disclosures:</strong> EU law requires sellers to clearly explain the terms of the agreement, including the right of withdrawal, the exact product offered, and long-term obligations. If these details were unclear or hidden, your contract may be unenforceable.</li>
        <li><strong>Perpetuity Clauses:</strong> Contracts that tie you in “for life” or automatically transfer obligations to your children are generally unlawful and have already been ruled invalid by several courts.</li>
        <li><strong>Sales Misrepresentation:</strong> Were you promised a resale market, investment return, or exclusive benefits that turned out to be false? That could qualify as misleading commercial practice, giving you grounds to rescind the contract and claim damages.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
      <p><strong>The European Legal Position – Explained Simply</strong><br>
      The European Timeshare Directive (2008/122/EC) replaced earlier legislation and introduced stronger consumer safeguards. All EU Member States, including Spain, Portugal, and Cyprus, were required to transpose this Directive into national law. This means your rights are protected even if the contract was signed abroad.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You can cancel the contract without penalty within the withdrawal period.</li>
        <li>Any advance payments made during that period are strictly forbidden.</li>
        <li>Sellers must provide detailed, written information in your own language before the contract is signed.</li>
        <li>If the seller failed to meet these obligations, your contract may be legally void – and you may have the right to recover your money.</li>

      <p><strong>Why It’s Better to Exit – Or Claim Compensation</strong><br>
      Timeshare contracts can become a financial burden. Rising maintenance fees, inflexible usage, and the inability to resell mean many owners end up paying for a product they no longer use – or never really wanted in the first place.</p>

      <p><strong>With Quaerens on your side, you have two strong options:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Exit Your Contract Legally</strong> – We use legal arguments based on EU and national law to help you terminate your timeshare contract, so you can walk away without future obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Claim Compensation</strong> – If your contract is invalid or you were misled, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund, plus interest and legal costs. Courts in Spain and across Europe have already awarded compensation to thousands of owners.</li>
      </ol>

      Contact us now to begin the legal process of terminating your timeshare agreement and reclaim control over your finances and freedom.</p>

      <p><strong>Below is a brief overview of why many people choose to exit their timeshare contract:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Unexpected Costs</strong> – Annual maintenance fees often increase without clear justification or limit..</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Flexibility</strong> – Exchanging locations or weeks is typically complicated, expensive, and subject to limited availability.</li>
        <li><strong>Resale is Nearly Impossible</strong> – Most timeshare contracts are virtually unsellable due to unfavourable terms and lack of market demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Misleading Sales Practices</strong> – Many owners were promised benefits during the sales process that turned out to be false or unattainable.</li>
        <li><strong>Debt Passed to Heirs</strong> – Contractual obligations often transfer to heirs, creating a long-term financial burden.</li>
        <li><strong>No Longer in Use</strong> – Changes in health, family circumstances, or travel preferences often make the timeshare irrelevant or unusable.</li>

      <p><strong>Assurances and Guarantees Included in the Timeshare Exit Service Agreement</strong></p>
        <ul>
        The timeshare exit and termination of your timeshare contract includes a guarantee period of up to two months. This means that it will take no longer than two months for your timeshare contract to be legally removed from your responsibility, and that you will no longer have any payment obligations to the timeshare organisation with which your contract is held.

        You will receive from our legal partner a copy of the written legal correspondence relating to the procedure for your timeshare exit and contract termination.
        
        Invoicing for your service agreement will take place only after all legal correspondence has been processed. In other words, you only pay once the work has been completed.</p>

      <p><strong>Most Asked Questions About Exiting a Timeshare Contract</strong></p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
        <li><strong>Why am I still paying maintenance fees if I don’t use the timeshare?</strong>
          Many owners are shocked to learn they’re contractually bound to pay rising annual fees even if they haven’t used their timeshare in years.</li>
        <li><strong>Can I just stop paying and walk away from the contract?</strong>
          No — stopping payments can lead to debt collection, legal action, and credit damage. A formal legal exit is the safest route.</li>
        <li><strong>Why can’t I sell or transfer my timeshare?</strong>
          Most timeshare contracts contain restrictive clauses that make resale nearly impossible, especially with no demand in the resale market.</li>
        <li><strong>I was promised flexibility — why is it so hard to book what I want?</strong>
          Exchange programs often have hidden fees, limited availability, and blackout dates, making it difficult to get the holidays you were sold.</li>
        <li><strong>Can my children inherit this timeshare and its costs?</strong>
          Yes. Many timeshare contracts pass to heirs automatically, creating a financial burden for future generations.</li>
        <li><strong>The salesperson misled me. Does that matter legally?</strong>
          Yes. If you were misled or not properly informed at the time of purchase, your contract may be void under consumer protection laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Is my timeshare contract valid under EU law?</strong>
          It depends. Many older or foreign contracts fail to meet EU Directive 2008/122/EC requirements and can be legally challenged.</li>
        <li><strong>What’s the guarantee that I’ll be released from my contract?</strong>
          Quaerens offers a guarantee period (two months) and provides written evidence once the termination process is complete.</li>
        <li><strong>How long does the exit process take?</strong>
          Typically, it takes between 4 to 8 weeks, depending on the complexity of the contract and the timeshare company’s cooperation.</li>
        <li><strong>Do I have to pay anything upfront?</strong>
          Some initial fees, such as translation or administrative costs, may apply at the start. However, Quaerens invoices the main legal work only once the exit process is completed and confirmed in writing.</li>
      </ol>

    <div class="info-box">
      <p><strong>Most Asked Questions About Claiming Timeshare Compensation</strong></p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
        <li><strong>Am I entitled to compensation for my timeshare contract?</strong>
          You may be eligible if your contract was mis-sold, lacks legal disclosures, or violates EU consumer protection laws such as Directive 2008/122/EC.</li>
        <li><strong>What are the most common legal reasons for a valid claim?</strong>
          Claims often succeed due to misrepresentation, lack of cooling-off information, illegal upfront payments, or failure to provide documentation in your native language.</li>
        <li><strong>Is my contract automatically void if it breaches EU law?</strong>
          In many cases, yes. Courts in Spain and other EU countries have ruled that contracts breaching the Timeshare Directive are null and void.</li>
        <li><strong>How much compensation could I receive?</strong>
          Amounts vary, but successful claims often result in a full or partial refund of purchase fees, plus interest and in some cases legal costs.</li>
        <li><strong>What documents do I need to support my claim?</strong>
          Typically, your contract, payment proof (bank statements or receipts), and any promotional materials or correspondence from the seller.</li>
        <li><strong>Is it too late to claim if I signed the contract years ago?</strong>
          Not necessarily. Depending on the jurisdiction and the circumstances, claims may still be possible even years after signing.</li>
        <li><strong>I no longer have the paperwork — can I still claim?</strong>
          Possibly. Legal firms can often obtain documentation directly from the resort or sales company with your consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Will I have to go to court?</strong>
          In most cases, no. Claims are handled by legal professionals, and many cases are settled through correspondence or in court without requiring your personal attendance.</li>
        <li><strong>How long does the compensation process take?</strong>
          On average, between 4 to 12 months, depending on the jurisdiction, complexity, and whether the case must go to court.</li>
        <li><strong>Do I have to pay legal fees upfront?</strong>
          Some initial costs—such as translation fees and prosecutor-related expenses—are payable at the start of your case. However, the main legal fees for the preparation and handling of your claim are only invoiced once the case has been formally filed with the court.</li>
