        <p><strong>üè† Spanish Property Claims</strong></p>
        <p>Claim compensation for mis-sold Spanish mortgages and failed off-plan property purchases ‚Äî with Quaerens on a no win, no fee basis.</p>

        <p>Have you bought property in Spain and later discovered things weren‚Äôt as promised?<br/>
        Were you advised into taking out a risky or unclear mortgage?<br/>
        Did you pay for a property off-plan that was never delivered?</p>

        <p>You're not alone. Over the last 20 years, tens of thousands of international buyers ‚Äì especially from the UK, Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, and Scandinavia ‚Äì were mis-sold mortgages or lost money in off-plan property schemes that breached Spanish and EU consumer protection laws.</p>

        <h3>üè¶ Mis-Sold Spanish Mortgages</h3>
        <p>Many foreigners were persuaded by estate agents, banks, or brokers to take out Spanish mortgages that were inappropriate, complex, or even unlawful. These were often pushed as part of "investment packages" and signed without the buyer understanding the long-term financial consequences.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>‚úÖ Most mortgage agreements signed before 2019 qualify for legal challenge.</li>
          <li>‚úÖ Even if your mortgage has been fully repaid, you may still have a valid claim.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üîç What Went Wrong?</h3>
        <p><strong>1. Foreign Currency Loans</strong><br/>Banks offered mortgages in Swiss francs, Japanese yen, or other currencies to non-Spanish buyers, claiming these loans had ‚Äúlower interest.‚Äù In reality, these were high-risk and unstable products.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Lack of Transparency</strong><br/>Many agreements were only in Spanish, lacked proper breakdowns, and failed affordability checks ‚Äî violating Spanish and EU laws (Directive 2014/17/EU).</p>
        <p><strong>3. Unregulated ‚ÄúEquity Release‚Äù Schemes</strong><br/>Sold to retirees as pension boosters, these were often unregulated and highly risky.</p>

        <h3>üèóÔ∏è Off-Plan Property Claims</h3>
        <p>Thousands of buyers paid for off-plan homes that were never finished, never registered, or built without permission. Most lacked the legally required bank guarantees (Law 57/1968), making the banks liable for refunds and interest.</p>

        <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Your Legal Rights in Spain</h3>
        <p>Spanish law and Supreme Court rulings now support claims based on mis-selling, lack of transparency, and missing bank guarantees.</p>
        <p>üìú You have the right to cancel your mortgage, get refunded, or be compensated by the bank.</p>
